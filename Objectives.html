   <strong> Have a personal brand</strong>
   <p>
    When setting your goals, stand out from the rest by developing a personal brand. Developing your brand helps you have opportunities and tech companies reaching out to you. Having a personal brand as a developer enables you to share your knowledge instead of trying to sell your service.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Develop a technical blog</strong>
    
    <BR>

You can have a technical blog where you teach other developers how to code, debug, and optimize. You can be active and involved in industry conferences and meetups. There are many platforms in the world and what you need to do is choose the ones that align with your career goals and pursue them. You can be a speaker at those events instead of just coding most of your time. It helps you build your network and develop interpersonal skills.
</p>
<p>
<b> Find your best team fit</b><br>

Technical talent alone doesn’t offer satisfaction within a team, and other qualities are needed. Finding the best team that has the same professional goals as yours is essential in achieving your goals. You need to have chemistry, trust, conflict resolution and communication to achieve your goals. Research has shown that team cohesiveness has a direct impact on positive job satisfaction. It is good to look at the qualities of the team you want to work with to ensure it’s the best fit.

    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
